# Experiments

This folder contains all the necessary files for running the experiments described in the paper. 

## Directory Structure

- The `benchmarks` folder contains the sets of PHCs generated by template-based algorithms on different problems:

    - `almost-sure-termination` benchmarks are generated by the algorithm in [1] on benchmarks of [2] and [3].
    - `polysynth` benchmarks are instances presented in [4].
    - `RevTerm` benchmarks regard non-termination of programs and are generated by RevTerm [5] on the TermComp C-Integer category.
    - `Termination` benchmarks are generated by [6] on the TermComp C-Integer category.

- Each of the `configs-*` folders contain the configurations of PolyHorn for solving the benchmarks using a specific set of heuristics. For detailed description, please refer to the tool paper.
    - `configs-base` are those configs that use no heuristics
    - `configs-h1` are the configs that make use of the *Assume-SAT* heuristic
    - `configs-h2` are the configs that make use of the *UNSAT Core* heuristic
    - `configs-h12` are the configs that make use of both heuristics

- There are four `Results-*.csv` files, that contain the results we obtained by running PolyHorn on the respective benchmark set.

## How to Run Experiments 

To run all the experiments in the paper, one can run `python run_all.py` which runs PolyHorn on the benchmarks in the `benchmarks` folder using their respective config files. This command runs experiments one by one and you will get the results in `outputs` folder. However, this command takes a long time (several weeks) to terminate. 
For this reason, we have included the commands that should be run for solving each of the benchmarks in the `Outputs-*.csv` files. 

To obtain the figures that are presented in the paper, you can run the following commands: 
```bash
python fig1-left.py
```
```bash
python fig1-right.py
